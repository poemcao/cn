title: Disabling elements in Moodle forms
excerpt: Explanation of how to disable elements in moodle forms
---
<p>
    The moodle forms library is a wrapper of the PEAR QuickForm library,
    easy to use and very straightforward. One of the problems I found
    myself with, while working with this libray, is disabling elements.
    To do this there is a method called <b>disabledIf()</b> which allows
    you to disable elements based on the state of another.
</p>
<p>
    What I was interested in though, is disabling an element based on the
    value of a variable that I sent to the form, at creation time. This was
    not really documented, or at least I haven't found a tutorial or
    indications of how to do it.
</p>
<p>
    So after a bit of research into the source code, and some trial and error,
    I found out that using numerical boolean variables as parameters to the
    <b>disabledIf()</b> function you can enable/disable elements from the form,
    without the dependency on the state of another element.
    Here is an example:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2644894.js?file=disable_moodle_form.php"></script>
<p>
    Now you only have to update the disabled_select variable when you display
    the form to have the select enabled or disabled.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2644982.js"></script>
<p>
    Of course you can enable/disable multiple elements using this method,
    reusing the <b>$disabled</b> variable that you create at the beginning,
    or use diferent variables to set different states to different elements.
    This method also works with groups of elements.
