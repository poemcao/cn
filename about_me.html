<div class="span6">
  <h2>Breathe</h2>
  <p>If you feel overwhelmed, breathe. It will calm you and release the tensions.</p>
  <p>If you are worried about something coming up, or caught up in something that already happened, breathe. It will bring you back to the present.</p>
  <p>If you are moving too fast, breathe. It will remind you to slow down, and enjoy life more.</p>
  <p>Breathe, and enjoy each moment of this life. They’re too fleeting and few to waste.</p>
